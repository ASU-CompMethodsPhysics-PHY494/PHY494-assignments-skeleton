# Project 1: To Brake Or Not To Brake

You will investigate the decisions that a driver can make when braking
for a traffic light that switches from green to yellow by writing code
in Python to model the car's behavior for different decisions and
parameters. You will write a short report to communicate, discuss and
summarize your reasoning and your results.
